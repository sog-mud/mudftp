This is the mudFTP v2 client package. Two clients are available:

Java
====

The Java client is in the java directory and was written by Oliver Jowett.
It will run on any platform that has Java (JRE or JDK) or via an applet.
<insert info about how to run as an applet>. To run it as an application,
run something like this:

cd /path/to/mudftp
java CLIClient Hostname FTPPort Username Password EditorCommand

The FTPPort is typically 6 higher than the main port. The editor command
should be whatever editor you wish to run when a new file is fetched. The
name of the file to be edited will be passed as the first argument.


The C client
============

The C client runs under UNIX and Windows32 (tested on Windows95 and NT).

Compiling for UNIX
------------------

Go to the client/c directory and run a "make" there.  Copy the resulting
file "mudftp" into your path somewhere.

Compiling for Win32
-------------------

There is a pre-compiled binary for use, but if for some reason you should
wish to compile the source yourself you can try using the Makefile.w32.
The pre-compiled binary was compiled using a mingw32 Linux cross-compiler.
It should also compile with minimal fuss under MS Visual C++.

Note that the Windows version of mudFTP is a command line program, rather
than graphical unlike many Windows programs.


Usage on either UNIX or Win32
---------------------------------

After connecting to the mudFTP-enabled MUD, run "mudftp push MUDNAME".

MUDNAME is the MUD's name in your configuration file. That file is
typically located in your home directory, and named .mudftp. You can
override the location by setting the MUDFTP environment variable to
something else.

If you are running under Windows, mudFTP will look for a file named 
"mudftp.cfg" in its current directory.  Also, you can specify an alternate
location by setting the MUDFTP environment variable to its location.
  set MUDFTP=c:\path\to\config\file

If you are using WindowsNT and are not logged on with administrator
priveledges and mudFTP complains about not being able to create files then
you will need to set the MUDFTP_TEMP variable to some directory that you
have write permissions in;
  set MUDFTP_TEMP=c:\temp\

A sample configuration file is provided.  It is usable with either the UNIX
or Win32 version of mudFTP.

The layout of this file is fairly simple: there are 6 words for each line:

mud Mudname Hostname Port Username Password

MUDNAME is the name you wish to give this MUD and which you will use later
when running the client. Port is the FTP Port, and should be 6 higher
than the normal MUD port. Example:

mud ar abandoned.org 4450 drylock qwerty

will define a new MUD nicknamed "ar", whose ftp port resides at abandoned.org
port 4450, and on which you are "drylock" with password "qwerty".

You MUST also specify how to run the editor by supplying:

editor EditorCommand

e.g. Editor EDIT.COM or Editor /usr/bin/joe. If you supply a % somewhere
in the editor command (the command can be several words), it gets
replaced with the filename of file to be edited. Otherwise, the name
is appended.


Good editor commands
====================

Under Linux, the following is handy as an editor command:

open -e -s /usr/bin/joe +999 %

This will open a new Virtual Terminal, switch to it, run the command, wait
for it to finish and then switch back. This is ideal with mcl.

The +999 will make the editor start at line 999 (i.e. at the bottom of the
file).

Under Windows, try:

editor start /w edit %

  or

editor start /w wordpad %

Note that when using Windows, the 'start /w' is rather important.  If you
don't know what it does, don't worry about it, but don't leave it out.

For further windows32 specific information, look at the file readme.w32.
